title: Watch Uncle Bob code: episodes 1 and 2
---

I've recently started watching a series of codecasts by Robert Martin, known in
developer's communities as 'Uncle Bob'. In that series, called
[Java Case Study][case-study], Uncle Bob with his son Micah work together to
rebuild the Clean Coders website in Java. The series is meant to demonstrate the
principles of object-oriented design and development practices, applied to a
real-world application.

I've only watched episodes 1 and 2 so far, but it's already gave quite a lot of
food for thought, which I would like to share in this post.

# Clean architecture

# Start with an acceptance test

# I would start differently
