title: Your plan sucks, but you don't have to
---

Your plan sucks. Again. Despite all those backlog grooming workshops; despite
all nicely ordered by priorities, accurately estimated user stories in Jira;
despite carefully written acceptance criteria for each story. What is it, this
time?  Have you encountered a bug in a framework you use? Or is it an unexpected
maintenance request from the field? Last week it was a legacy piece of code that
you'd forgotten about on a planning session. The week before it was a flu
outbreak that made half of the team stay home sick.

Let me tell you something. Your plans will suck. Always. But that's an amazing
thing.

# The problem

As programmers, we like to be precise and accurate. That's how we write programs
- precisely and accurately, so that the program does what's needed when it's
needed.
