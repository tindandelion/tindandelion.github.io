title: Transforming the software industry
---

*In early 2015, I attended a ScanAgile conference in Helsniki. The keynote talk
on this conference was given by [Gojko Adzic][gojko], in which he presented his
vision on what was going to be a next big change in the software industry. This
blog post is a recap of his talk. The full video recording of the presentation
can be found [here][video-recording].*

# Where we are now - a Factory metafor

Let’s begin with a historical analogy. At the beginning of the industrial era,
most factory buildings were tall and relatively thin. The reason for such design
was that factory machinery then was driven by steam, and it was the most
efficient structure to have a single big steam generator in the basement. To
deliver steam to machines in a most efficient way was to organize them
vertically, that is why factory buildings had multiple floors and relatively
small horizontal area.

When electricity superceded steam generators, the situation changed. With
electrical engines, it doesn’t matter how you put the wires - the delivery of
electricity is cheap, and so other constraints start to become critical - for
example, the cost of moving the components across many floors, compared to
moving in horizontal directions. Eventually, with electrical engines the factory
buildings started to become small in height and very wide in area. 

However, there was a transitional period when the benefits of electrical engines
were not fully recognized, and the factory buildings were still designed in a
steam-era fashion - tall and thin, even though this constraint was no longer
valid.

How does that relate to the software industry? Gojko claims that we are now in a
similar transitional phase. While agile approach is widely adopted by the
development teams, the business hasn't yet recognized all its potential and
still operates in an old-fashined way.

# Water-scrum-fall

Gojko quotes the Forrester Research report saying that the most popular form of
adopting agile approach in organizations is *Water-Scrum-Fall*. In such process,
important business decisions are made and requirements are fixed up-front
(*Water-* phase). These requirements and plans are then taken by the development
teams that implement them into software in an iterative manner (*-Scrum-*
phase). However, the intermediate results are not taken into production until
all the up-front requirements are implemented, and only then the Big Bang
release happens, with all its attributes like marketing campaign, media events
and such (*-Fall* phase).

When work is organized this way, it actually doesn't really matter that the
software is implemented in the short increments internally, because the overall
process is still governed by a trditional big up-front planning and long release
schedules. Sure, incremental development helps keep budget and time constraints
under control, but that's all we can get from it. Business still overlooks the
opportunities enabled by the fact the development team produces releasable
product with much higher frequency than the business side of the organization
can consume.
