title: Inversion of Control principle explained
---

I've had a 'water cooler chat' with my teammates recently, and occasionally one
of us mentioned that he never understood the concept of 'Inversion of Control'.
We all started to give our own explanations but, to my surprise, nobody could
give anything better than hand-waving and a mumble 'The flow of control is
inverted, and so...'. Oh, and one thing everyone remembered was that
[Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a
good illustration of the IoC, thanks to the
[great article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) by Martin
Fowler on the subject.

I was no better than the others, having realized suddenly that I couldn't
soundly explain even why this principle was called so. Then I decided to spend
some time filling the blanks in my education. This post is my report based on
the study I've made.

The biggest problem of explaining the meaning of IoC is that nowdays it's used
everywhere and considered 'obvious' by many. Yet, there was time when a huge
mind shift was required for this new style of application design to be widely
adopted.

Back in the 80's the most popular style of application design was *structured
design*.
